# ML-mechanics
A gears-level understanding of core tools in ML

### Goals

Implement the following without any ML libraries, i.e. mostly with just numpy
- [ ] Backpropagation to solve a linear regression, compared with the SSE answer
- [ ] Backprop for logistic regression for some easy task
- [ ] a recurrent neural network
- [ ] A convolutional neural network
- [ ] Transformer architecture (maybe in separate repo as part of following Karpathy's tutorials)
